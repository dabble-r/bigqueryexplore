# BigQuery SQL Explorer & Chart Builder

# Big Query Client 2

A lightweight Streamlit application for exploring Google BigQuery datasets, running custom SQL queries, and visualizing query results with an interactive chart builder. The app emphasizes clarity, fast iteration, and a smooth workflow for both beginners and experienced developers.

## 🚀 Features

- Connects to **BigQuery** using service account credentials  
- Browse public datasets and view available tables  
- Run **custom SQL queries** directly in the app  
- Graceful SQL error handling (no crashes or state loss)  
- Visualize SQL query results using:
  - Scatter plots  
  - Line charts  
  - Bar charts  
- Chart Builder auto-detects numeric and categorical fields  
- Sidebar activates only after a successful SQL query  
- No BigQuery calls triggered by sidebar interactions  
- Plotting always uses the **SQL query output**, not dataset tables
